############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id={{kafka_server_broker_id}}

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The port the socket server listens on
port={{kafka_server_port}}

# Hostname the broker will bind to and advertise to producers and consumers.
# If not set, the server will bind to all interfaces and advertise the value returned from
# from java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
host.name={{kafka_host_name}}

# The number of threads handling network requests
num.network.threads={{kafka_server_num_network_threads}}

# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads={{kafka_server_num_io_threads}}

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes={{kafka_server_socket_send_buffer_bytes}}

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes={{kafka_server_socket_receive_buffer_bytes}}

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes={{kafka_server_socket_request_max_bytes}}


############################# Log Basics #############################

# The directory under which to store log files
log.dir={{kafka_local_dir}}/logs

# The number of logical partitions per topic per server. More partitions allow greater parallelism
# for consumption, but also mean more files.
num.partitions={{kafka_server_num_partitions}}

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. This is the most
# important performance knob in kafka.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data is at greater risk of loss in the event of a crash.
#    2. Latency: Data is not made available to consumers until it is flushed (which adds latency).
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages={{kafka_server_log_flush_interval_messages}}

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms={{kafka_server_log_flush_interval_ms}}

# Per-topic overrides for log.flush.interval.ms
#log.flush.intervals.ms.per.topic=topic1:1000, topic2:3000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
log.retention.hours={{kafka_server_log_retention_hours}}

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes={{kafka_server_log_segment_bytes}}

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.cleanup.interval.mins={{kafka_server_log_cleanup_interval_mins}}

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
