# name:      volume name. it can't include the ':' character
#

#
# variable substitutions:
# you can use variables for both <path> and <name> now. here are the
# rules:
#     1) if you specify an unknown variable, it will not get converted.
#     2) if you specify a known variable, but that variable doesn't have
#        a value, it will get ignored.
#
# the variables:
# $b   -> basename of path
# $c   -> client's ip or appletalk address
# $d   -> volume pathname on server
# $f   -> full name (whatever's in the gecos field)
# $g   -> group
# $h   -> hostname
# $i   -> client ip without tcp port or appletalk network
# $s   -> server name (can be the hostname)
# $u   -> username (if guest, it's whatever user guest is running as)
# $v   -> volume name (either ADEID_NAME or basename of path)
# $z   -> zone (may not exist)
# $$   -> $
#

#
# casefold options [syntax: casefold:option]:
# tolower    -> lowercases names in both directions
# toupper    -> uppercases names in both directions
# xlatelower -> client sees lowercase, server sees uppercase
# xlateupper -> client sees uppercase, server sees lowercase
#
# allow/deny/rwlist/rolist format [syntax: allow:user1,@group]:
# user1,@group,user2  -> allows/denies access from listed users/groups
#                        rwlist/rolist control whether or not the
#                        volume is ro for those users.
# allowed_hosts       -> Only listed hosts and networks are allowed,
#                        all others are rejected. Example:
#                        allowed_hosts:10.1.0.0/16,10.2.1.100
# denied_hosts        -> Listed hosts and nets are rejected,
#                        all others are allowed. Example:
#                        denied_hosts: 192.168.100/24,10.1.1.1
# preexec             -> command to be run when the volume is mounted,
#                        ignore for user defined volumes
# root_preexec        -> command to be run as root when the volume is mounted,
#                        ignore for user defined volumes
# postexec            -> command to be run when the volume is closed,
#                        ignore for user defined volumes
# root_postexec       -> command to be run as root when the volume is closed,
#                        ignore for user defined volumes
# veto                -> hide files and directories,where the path matches
#                        one of the "/" delimited vetoed names. Matches are
#                        partial, e.g. path is /abc/def/file and veto:/abc/
#                        will hide the file.
# adouble             -> specify the format of the metadata files.
#                        default is "v2". netatalk 1.x used "v1".
#                        "osx" cannot be treated normally any longer.
# volsizelimit        -> size in MiB.  Useful for TimeMachine: limits the
#                         reported volume size, thus preventing TM from using
#                         the whole real disk space for backup.
#                         Example: "volsizelimit:1000" would limit the
#                         reported disk space to 1 GB.


#
# codepage options [syntax: options:charsetname]
# volcharset          -> specifies the charset to be used
#                        as the volume codepage
#                        e.g. "UTF8", "UTF8-MAC", "ISO-8859-15"
# maccharset          -> specifies the charset to be used
#                        as the legacy client (<=Mac OS 9) codepage
#                        e.g. "MAC_ROMAN", "MAC_CYRILLIC"

#                        for CNIDs. Only used with CNID backend "dbd".
#                        This option here overrides any setting from

# password:password   -> set a volume password (8 characters max)
# cnidscheme:scheme   -> set the cnid scheme for the volume,

# ea                  -> none|auto|sys|ad
#                        Specify how Extended Attributes are stores. default
#                        is auto.
#                        auto: try "sys" (by setting an EA on the shared
#                              directory itself), fallback to "ad".  Requires
#                              writable volume for performing the test.
#                              Note: options:ro overwrites "auto" with "none."
#                        sys:  Use filesystem EAs
#                        ad:   Use files in AppleDouble directories
#                        none: No EA support

#                        specified.
# nohex               -> don't do :hex translations for anything
#                        except dot files. specify usedots as well if
#                        you want that turned off. note: this option
#                         makes the / character illegal.
# usedots             -> don't do :hex translation for dot files. note: when
#                        this option gets set, certain file names
#                        become illegal. these are .Parent and
#                        anything that starts with .Apple.
# invisibledots       -> don't do :hex translation for dot files. note: when
#                        this option gets set, certain file names

#                        anything that starts with .Apple. also, dot
#                        files created on the unix side are marked invisible.
# limitsize           -> limit disk size reporting to 2GB. this is
#                        here for older macintoshes using newer
#                        appleshare clients. yucko.
# nofileid            -> don't advertise createfileid, resolveid, deleteid

# nocnidcache         -> Don't store and read CNID to/from AppleDouble file.
#                        This should not be used as it also prevents a CNID
#                        database rebuild with `dbd`!
# caseinsensitive     -> The underlying FS is case insensitive (only
#                        test with JFS in OS2 mode)
# dropbox             -> Allows a volume to be declared as being a "dropbox."
#                        Note that netatalk must be compiled with dropkludge
#                        support for this to function. Warning: This option
#                        is deprecated and might not work as expected.
# dropkludge          -> same as "dropbox"
# nodev               -> always use 0 for device number, helps when the
